<h1>Sigmoid Colon: A Biologically Inspired Activation Function</h1>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Activation functions used in neural networks are often selected
  based on intuition or dubious theoretical grounding. 
  Biology has long served as an inspiration for many innovations in machine
  learning, but has had limited success in informing novel activation functions.
  In this work, we revisit the idea of the sigmoid function, \(S(x) = \frac{1}{1
  + e^{-x}}\), and discover that the shape of the similarly-named Sigmoid colon, a portion of
  the human large intestine, outperforms the traditional sigmoid function. We
  find a 4% improvement on MNIST, resulting in state of the art performance for
  gastrointestinally inspired models. Source code for our
  activation function and tracing tool is available at <a
  href="https://github.com/poopingface/sigmoidcolon">https://github.com/poopingface/sigmoidcolon</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Coming soon.</p>
<h3>Tracing Human Physiology</h3>
<p>
    In order to achieve the best performance, we must obtain an accurate
    2-dimensional path of the human sigmoid colon. We facilitate this by
    developing an interactive tool, which allows medical professionals to trace
    the path of the sigmoid colon on patient MRI scans. The extension of this
    traced path to cover the domain \((-\infty, \infty)\) will serve as our
    activation function.

<h3>Polynomial Fit</h3>

<p>To maintain differentiability and improve run time efficiency, we replace the
traced colon function with a polynomial fit. This fit gives us the final equation for our activation function:</p>
<p>$$\sigma_\text{colon}(x) = -0.000198382 * x ^ 3 + 0.133785 * x ^ 2 + -29.0015 * x + 2345.68$$</p>
